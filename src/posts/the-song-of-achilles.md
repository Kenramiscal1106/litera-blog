The novel The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller humanizes well-known mythological figures like 
Achilles and Patroclus to life, making their love story not just sad but also very touching. I love how the author showed their struggles with fate, their vulnerability, and the deep love they had for each other. The focus on their emotions made their relationship feel real and heartfelt. I felt a strong sense of sadness and helplessness because Patroclus’ choice to fight in Achilles’ place came from his love and loyalty, but it led to tragedy. I admired how the author showed Patroclus’ selflessness and dedication, which made his death even more painful to read about. What I liked most was the emotional impact of his sacrifice, it was both sad and beautiful. While I didn’t dislike 
anything about the book, I felt upset and heartbroken because of their tragic ending. The conclusion left me feeling both sad and thankful for the love they shared, even though it didn’t last.

This story connects to my life because it shows how much we are willing to give up for the people we 
love. Patroclus’ decision to take Achilles’ place reminds me of the times I’ve put others first, even without thinking about the risks. His loyalty and love felt pure, and it made me think about my own relationships, especially when I’ve had to make tough choices. The desire to protect someone you care about, even if it costs you, is something I can relate to. The story also reminded me of how love can be complicated, no matter how much we care about someone; fate or life can get in the way. I’ve experienced getting close to people only for time and distance to pull us apart. This theme of loving despite knowing it won’t last made me think about how important it is to value the time we have with those we love.

Patroclus acted out of love and a sense of duty to Achilles. He couldn’t watch his friends die without doing something, so he stepped in, believing he could make a difference. His choice came from his loyalty and the belief that he was the only one who could help. Achilles didn’t make Patroclus fight, but when he found out about his death, he was filled with anger and sorrow. I think Patroclus’ brave act made Achilles feel protective, leading him to seek revenge on Hector. Both of them struggled between their personal feelings and the larger forces of fate they couldn’t control.

If I were in Patroclus’ place, I think I would feel torn between wanting to protect someone I love and being afraid of what might happen to me. While Patroclus acted selflessly, I would hope I could be as brave as he was. At the same time, I would want to think about the consequences more carefully. If I were Achilles, I think I would have reacted the same way—with grief and anger—but I would also want to honor the sacrifice of someone I loved without causing more harm.

I think the novel is meant for readers who enjoy stories about love, loss, and Greek mythology. Its deep 
emotions, themes, and focus on human struggles would appeal to people who like stories about relationships and new ways of seeing myths. It might also connect with young adults and older readers who have gone through love, loss, or difficult choices in their lives.

The characters, especially Patroclus, felt real to me, which surprised me because they are legendary 
figures. Their love was beautiful but sad, and it made me think about how much I would be willing to give for someone I care about. What stood out most was Patroclus’ loyalty. He wasn’t admired for being a strong warrior but for how deeply he loved Achilles. I admired how he didn’t hesitate to risk his life for Achilles, even though he knew it could lead to his death. At first, I felt sorry for Patroclus and wished he had chosen differently. But as I read more, I realized his love for Achilles was something I could relate to because sometimes we act out of love, even when we know the risks. This made me think about my own relationships and whether I would have the courage to make such sacrifices.

The more I thought about the book, the more my understanding of the characters changed. At first, I 
thought Achilles’ reaction to Patroclus’ death was just anger. But later, I saw it was also because of his deep love and the pain of losing him. This made me appreciate Achilles more because his love, though complicated, was real.

In the end, The Song of Achilles taught me that love can be both beautiful and painful. It made me think 
about how far I would go for someone I love and what happens when love meets fate. Each time I read it, I notice something new because of the different experiences I’ve had. The emotions and lessons in the story always make me think about love, sacrifice, and the importance of cherishing the people I care about
